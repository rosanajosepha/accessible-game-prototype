# Accessible Game Prototype (IN-PROGRESS)
A proof-of-concept game demonstrating accessibility features for visually and hearing-impaired players.

# Overview
This project is part of my CAHSI LREU research on improving accessibility in video games. The game is built from the ground up with features designed to enhance the experience for visually and hearing-impaired players. It serves as a proof of concept to showcase best practices in accessible game design.

# Features
• **High-Contrast Mode** – Improves visibility for players with low vision.

• **Text-to-Speech (TTS) Support** – Reads in-game text aloud for blind players.

• **Customizable Subtitles** – Adjustable size, color, and speaker labels for better readability.

• **Haptic Feedback** – Provides alternative cues for in-game events.

• **Sound Cues & Visual Indicators** – Reinforces important gameplay information through multiple sensory channels.

# Tech Stack
• **Engine:** Unity (C#)

• **Tools:** Procreate (for assets), FMOD (for audio accessibility), Text-to-Speech APIs

• **Version Control:** GitHub
